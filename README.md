## Inspiration
Sign language is a universal language which allows many individuals to exercise their intellect through common communication. Many people around the world suffer from hearing loss and from mutism that needs sign language to communicate. Even those who do not experience these conditions may still require the use of sign language for certain circumstances. We plan to expand our company to be known worldwide to fill the lack of a virtual sign language learning tool that is accessible to everyone, everywhere, for free.

## What it does
Here at SignSpeak, we create an encouraging learning environment that provides computer vision sign language tests to track progression and to perfect sign language skills. The UI is built around simplicity and useability. We have provided a teaching system that works by engaging the user in lessons, then partaking in a progression test. The lessons will include the material that will be tested during the lesson quiz. Once the user has completed the lesson, they will be redirected to the quiz which can result in either a failure or success. Consequently, successfully completing the quiz will congratulate the user and direct them to the proceeding lesson, however, failure will result in the user having to retake the lesson. The user will retake the lesson until they are successful during the quiz to proceed to the following lesson.

## How we built it
We built SignSpeak on react with next.js. For our sign recognition, we used TensorFlow with a media pipe model to detect points on the hand which were then compared with preassigned gestures.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into multiple roadblocks mainly regarding our misunderstandings of Next.js.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we managed to come up with so many ideas in such little time.

## What we learned
Throughout the event, we participated in many workshops and created many connections. We engaged in many conversations that involved certain bugs and issues that others were having and learned from their experience using javascript and react. Additionally, throughout the workshops, we learned about the blockchain and entrepreneurship connections to coding for the overall benefit of the hackathon.

## What's next for SignSpeak
SignSpeak is seeking to continue services for teaching people to learn sign language. For future use, we plan to implement a suggestion box for our users to communicate with us about problems with our program so that we can work quickly to fix them. Additionally, we will collaborate and improve companies that cater to phone audible navigation for blind people.
